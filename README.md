Gmail Setup for Sending Email via Python

To use this project to send email via Gmail, you'll need to make a few changes to your Gmail account settings. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Allow Less Secure Apps
Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
Click on "Security" from the left menu
Scroll down to the "Less secure app access" section
Toggle the switch to "On"
Note: This setting makes your account more vulnerable, so you may want to create a separate Google account for sending emails via Python.
